### Pull on the new flesh like borrowed gloves and burn your fingers once again ###

I've been looking for a dead simple, smart and lightweight blog engine for a while. I've also been messing about with Sinatra, so figured I'd just write my own. Wish me luck!

**Requirements**

* sinatra
* haml
* yaml

**Thoughts**

Serialise blog posts to yaml. Possibly use redcloth for markdown support in posts. Haml/Sass for styling needs.
